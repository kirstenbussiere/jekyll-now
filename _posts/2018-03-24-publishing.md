**Open Textbooks**

The costs of education in many countries, Canada included, are rapt with egregious fees - including high tuition rates and expsensive textbooks. As a result, access to education is limited for individuals coming from lower income households who often cannot afford to go to school. While not resolving all the issues surrounding the commodification of education, open source textbooks take a step in thr right direction, toward a world of free and available knowledge.
