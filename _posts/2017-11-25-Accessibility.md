## Digital Humanities is for Everyone

**accessible, adj**
 
 "Able to be received, acquired, or made use of; open or available"
 
**What is Accessibility?**
 
According to CBC 13.7 per cent of Canadians live with a disability meaning that over 3.8 million people identify as having some sort of disability. With over 1 in 10 people affected and the statistics rising as we age it is imperative that our focus is on ensuring the world is accessible. 

But what does it mean to be accessible?

Everyone has different needs in order to easily access content and people with disabilities often have specific requirements. When we are publishing content online, it is imperative that we are aware of the fact that people have needs we may not and do our best to accomodate. As a student with non-verbal learning disability, accessibility has long been on my radar as an important discussion to be having. 
 
 Universal Design:
 
 "Universal design is design that involves conscious decisions about accessibility for all, and it is a philosophy that should be adopted more widely by digital humanities scholars." -
