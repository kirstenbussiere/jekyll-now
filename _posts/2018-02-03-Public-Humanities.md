**public, _adj._**

"Open to general observation, view, or knowledge; existing, performed, or carried out without concealment, so that all may see or hear." 

Publishing Publically

While publishing in the open allows for knowledge to be more accessible there are a number of possible risks.Scholars are more likely to recieve criticism when they are allowing their work to open to the public - especially when working on controversial issues.
In Sarah E. Bond's article ‘Why We Need to Start Seeing the Classical World in Color’ she points to a link between the perception of the white marble statues of antiqity and white supremecist ideals. And yet, many of these statues were in fact once painted - something many people are not aware of. The fact that this misinformation feeds groups like white supremacists makes it so important for factual information and scholarly research to be available openly.
