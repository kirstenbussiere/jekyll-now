## One Amongst Many 

**"Crowd":, _n_.3**

"A large number of persons gathered so closely together as to press upon or impede each other; a throng, a dense multitude."

**We are a Community**

Studying the concept of communities has long been approached in academic fields as one that is inherently difficult. On the one hand, looking at communities from a purely unbiased scholarly perspective removes the emotional connection individuals have to certain groups - but on the other hand, emotional responses are inherently biased. The truth is, we cannot remove ourselves from the community because we are a part of it, so critically we have to look from an inside out. 

The digital world has further complicated this idea of community - moving it beyond physical spaces into the online world. As a result, people are part of a community based in geographies related to where they live, go to school, and work but they are also able to connect with people across the globe
