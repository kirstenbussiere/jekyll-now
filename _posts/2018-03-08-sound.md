Text Mining:

Text mining as a practise of the digital humanities has long been focused on the analysis of written discourse. Words are elevated on the data hierarchy as having a special sort of value that other information does not carry. Each word has a specific meaning, both on its own and in context. So text mining allows for this to meaning to be collected from large bodies of text, or corpora.
