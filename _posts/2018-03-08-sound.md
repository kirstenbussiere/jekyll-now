## Can you Hear me Now?

**Sound,_n_**
"The sensation produced in the organs of hearing when the surrounding air is set in vibration in such a way as to affect these; also, that which is or may be heard; the external object of audition, or the property of bodies by which this is produced. Hence also, pressure waves that differ from audible sound only in being of a lower or a higher frequency."

**Text Mining:**

Text mining as a practise of the digital humanities has long been focused on the analysis of written discourse. Words are elevated on the data hierarchy as having a special sort of value that other information does not carry. Each word has a specific meaning, both on its own and in context. So text mining allows for this to meaning to be collected from large bodies of text, or corpora.
