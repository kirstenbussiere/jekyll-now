## Visualizing the Invisible

**What is Visualization:**

Visualisation builds from ancient traditions of mapping visual data as a means of communication. Abstract data is transferred to a form of graphic variables that is visually represented. This work exposes information and patterns from large amounts of data that may not necessarily be visible to the researcher without the use of digital tools.

**Types of Visualization:**

- Static Visualizations - visualizations that move and cannot be manipulated
- Dynamic Visualizations - short animations that show change over a specific variable
- Interactive Visualizations - allow for the manipulation of graphic variables

**Visualization and Literature:**

While those who study language and literature often do not think of their studies as being concerned with the visual. I would argue though that visual aesthetics are very much involved in both the production, comprehension, and studies of literary artefacts. If visualization is focused in one regard on analysis of the visual elements of a data set, we can include images embedded in text as well as the shape of the text itself. My thoughts go to the concrete poetry of bpNichol in which the shape of the work is just as important as the semantic information embedded in each piece. This allows for researchers to perform a multimodal discourse analysis in which they interpret all elements of a data source. As well, visualization tools can be used to clarify and explain information in research. Often, literature is analysed in relation to the plot line which narrates the trajectory of a text. This is often something visualized in relation to literature, in which a visual image marks how the story develops. For instance, Christopher Booker argued that there are seven basic plots that are used in all stories. In his book, The Seven Basic Plots: Why We Tell Stories, he details these plots and their uses in literature. Using vizualization techniques we can map these out as a means to add another level of interpretation to the text. And so, literature is not just text but it is also the images that come along with it which means that we can both study the visuals of the text and also use visualization in order to clarify data in research.
