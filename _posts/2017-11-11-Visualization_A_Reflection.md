Visualisation builds from ancient traditions of mapping visual data as a means of communication. Abstract data is transferred to a form of graphic variables that is visually represented. This work exposes information and patterns from large amounts of data that may not necessarily be visible to the researcher without the use of digital tools.

**Types of Visualization:**

- Static Visualizations - visualizations that move and cannot be manipulated
- Dynamic Visualizations - short animations that show change over a specific variable
- Interactive Visualizations - allow for the manipulation of graphic variables

**Visualization and Literature:**

This allows for researchers to perform a multimodal discourse analysis in which they interpret all elements of a data source. As well, visualization tools can be used to clarify and explain information in research. Often, literature is analysed in relation
